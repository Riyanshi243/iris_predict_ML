Iris_predict_ML

This prediction is done using Unsupervised Machine Learning
In this task, we are required to predict the optimum number of cluster for the iris data set .Iris data set consists of 3 types of flower namely Iris-setosa Iris-versicolour and Iris-virginica.

To implement this model I am using Google Collab. The libraries used are Numpy, Pandas, sklearn and Matplotlib. There is a scatter plot at the end.
